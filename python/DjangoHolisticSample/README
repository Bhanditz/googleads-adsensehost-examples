ADSENSE HOST API HOLISTIC SAMPLE
================================

What is it?
-----------------

This sample is meant as an end-to-end guide for signing up publishers and
setting up advertising for them. The execution flow is roughly as follows:
- Start an association session, store it in the database linked to the user.
- Redirect the user to the generated signup URL.
- The user completes signup.
- The user gets redirected to the application callback page.
- Verify the received token, retrieve association and user from association
  session ID.
- Store publisher ID linked to the user.
- Create a new ad unit for the publisher.
- Generate ad code for the publisher.
- Redirect user to blog page, where the ad is now visible.


Quick Start Guide
-----------------

- Download and install Django:
      https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

- Download and install the latest version of the Google APIs Client Library for
  Python (google-api-python-client-{version}.zip or .tar.gz)
      https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list
  You can read more about setting things up on the client library documentation:
      https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started

- Modify samplehost/settings.py to add database information. Sample settings:
      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
              'NAME': '/path/to/your_db.db',
              'USER': '',
              'PASSWORD': '',
              'HOST': '',
              'PORT': '',
          }
      }

- Set TEMPLATE_DIRS to the absolute path to your template files. This is the
  'templates' subdirectory in your holistic sample installation:
      TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
          "/path/to/your/install/templates"
      )

- Initialize the database. From the root of your holistic sample installation:
      python manage.py syncdb

- Add your developer credentials to client_secrets.json.

- Run initial authentication against the API, to create adsensehost.dat (which
  will store the credential data you get back from Google's auth service).
  Remember to use your AdSense Host account for this. From the root of your
  holistic sample installation:
      python api_utils.py

- Run the application! From the root of your holistic sample installation:
      python manage.py runserver
